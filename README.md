# Machine-learning-for-E-commerce

##1- Description:
The data analyst team at your Company exported the Google Analytics logs for an ecommerce website into BigQuery and created a new table of all the raw ecommerce visitor session data for me to explore. Using this data, Iâ€™ll try to answer a few questions.
Question1: Out of the total visitors who visited our website, what % made a purchase?
Question2: How many visitors bought on subsequent visits to the website?
Question3: What are some of the reasons a typical ecommerce customer will browse but not buy until a later visit?
Question4: Create a Machine Learning model in BigQuery to predict whether or not a new user is likely to purchase in the future. Identifying these high-value users can help the marketing team target them with special promotions and ad campaigns to ensure a conversion while they comparison shop between visits to your ecommerce site.
